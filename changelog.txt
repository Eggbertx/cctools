2020-11-18 - 3.0 BETA 1 (2.95.0)
~~~~~~~~~~
New Tool: CC2Edit
  * Features:
    * Editing of maps (.c2m) and game scripts (.c2g) for Chip's Challenge 2
      (and the Steam version of CC1, which is based on the CC2 code base).
    * Playtesting of maps in Steam CC1 and CC2 (requires Steam to be running
      and logged in, due to restrictions in the game itself).
    * Many basic editing tools ported from CCEdit, including new features
      listed below.
    * Tile Inspector allows you to craft any combination of tiles, beyond
      those available via normal editing.  NOTE: Creating invalid tiles may
      cause unexpected behavior or crashes within the game.
    * Hint Inspector allows you to directly edit hint tiles without needing
      to count and manually modify the NOTE field.
    * Import (Lynx-compatible) levels from CC1 levelsets (.dat or .ccl).
      Imported levels can optionally be auto-resized to fit their content.
  * Still missing some key features; work ongoing to complete these before the
    final release of 3.0.
    * Drawing hint tiles doesn't update the hint order in the NOTE field.
    * Tile errors and monster paths are not currently rendered.
    * Tiles are not rendered in the same layer order as CC2 in some cases.
    * Teleport destination highlight doesn't respect wires yet.
    * HTML Report generation is not yet implemented.

CCEdit Changes:
  * It is now possible to playtest in MSCC from 64-bit Windows using WineVDM
    (https://github.com/otya128/winevdm).
  * Tab management is reworked for better usability (modeled after various
    code editors, such as vscode):
    - Loading a level already open in another tab will focus that tab, rather
      than opening a duplicate tab of the same level.
    - Opening a level not already open will open a "floating" tab (indicated
      with an italic title). This tab will be reused when switching to
      other levels not already open in a non-floating tab.
    - Making changes to a level, or double-clicking on the level or
      floating tab will cause the level to be opened in a non-floating
      mode, which means it will stay open until explicitly closed.
    - You can now middle-click anywhere on a tab to close it, in addition
      to the usual close button on the tab.
  * The Level Manager and the two Tiles pages now live in their own dockable
    widgets, and as such can be attached, detached, moved, and even hidden
    independently of each other.
  * Undo and Redo actions are now global to the entire levelset, not just
    the currently open level. This means you can undo changes even after
    closing a level's tab.
  * It is now possible to undo and redo changes to the levelset itself,
    such as adding/deleting/reordering levels and changing level properties.
  * Holding SHIFT (used for drawing directly on the lower layer) will now
    also reveal the lower layer by drawing the upper layer very faintly
    above it.
  * Copying a selection will now also copy a graphic of the selected tiles.
  * Add a flood-fill drawing tool.
  * Add a tile inspector tool, which can set any valid or invalid tile
    (except tile 255, which is reserved for RLE encoding).
  * Fixed a crash when dragging levels in the Levelset Organizer dialog.
  * Fixed a crash when using Pedantic mode in the Error Checker.
  * Fixed a crash when rendering levels that have tiles outside of the
    normal 00-6f range.
  * Fix: Monster paths now consider tanks switching direction, and account
    for things that manipulate monster direction such as force floors and
    ice corners.
  * Fixed some minor issues with HTML report generation.
  * Fix: Level numbers are no longer incorrect in the Level Manager after
    deleting levels from the Levelset Organizer.
  * Fix: Drawing tools no longer get "stuck" when CCEdit loses focus while
    the mouse is pressed.

CCPlay Changes:
  * It is now possible to play in MSCC from 64-bit Windows using WineVDM
    (https://github.com/otya128/winevdm).
  * CCPlay can now launch arbitrary Java-based tools (assuming the java
    executable is in your system PATH). This enables better support for
    tools like SuperCC and CCCreator.
  * The "Edit" button in CCPlay is now renamed "Open", and the list of
    Editors in the settings is now a list of Tools, to more clearly
    indicate that it can be used for more than just editors.
  * Levelsets are now sorted case-insensitively.
  * Fix: Don't throw an error trying to read an invalid .dat file (e.g.
    the unins000.dat that various setup programs create).
  * Fix: CCPlay no longer crashes when failing to parse levelset data in
    some more exotic levelsets.
  * Fix: Opening tools with a specific level selected now actually works.
  * Fix: Level names are now correctly interpreted as Latin-1.

CCHack Changes:
  * CCHack is back -- ported to Qt5 with a completely new UI. This means
    it is now usable on non-Windows platforms without Wine.
  * Add support for applying and removing code patches:
    - Always grant First Try bonus
    - ccpatch (fixes crash related to two masked tiles in the same space)
    - fullsec (always enable full first second)
    - pgchips (adds ice block support)
  * Extend menu editing to cover full Menu (and Accelerator) resource
    editing / replacement, rather than just modifying strings.
  * Fix: CCHack properly updates the "real" and "fake" last levels in multiple
    places in the code, rather than just one check.
  * Fix: CCHack no longer pollutes your current working directory with
    extracted bitmaps every time you load an existing executable.
  * NOTE: CCHack 3.0 *should* be able to read CCHack 1.2 patches (.ccp files),
    but newly created patch files are are not backwards compatible with
    CCHack 1.2. This is intentional, since the old patch format was actually
    somewhat broken, and we now store replaced bitmaps directly in the patch
    as well for easier distribution.
